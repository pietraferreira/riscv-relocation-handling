Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 15th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom Relocation Handling prototype.

Key activities:
* Implemented a first (rough) prototype of secondary howto table.

Planned Activities:
* Find a way to access the secondary howto table correctly.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,

Pietra
