Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 23rd lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
* Mitigated the cause of build fail by taking a different approach with implementation.

Planned activities:
* Continue to implement prototype.  
* Start testing.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
