Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 17th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
* Continue to prototype how to access the custom secondary howto table.

Planned activities:
* Continue to investigate and implement the mechanism to correctly access the
table and retrieve information.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,
Pietra
