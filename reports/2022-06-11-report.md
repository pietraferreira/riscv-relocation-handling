Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 21th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
- Investigate how `perform_relocation` works as to find a way to correctly implement access to secondary `howto` table.
- Investigate why failing to build (`undefined reference to riscv_elf_custom_relocid`).

Planned activities:
* Continue to implement prototype.
* Start testing.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
