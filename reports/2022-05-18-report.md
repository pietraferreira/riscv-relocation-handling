Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 18th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
* First prototype implemented and building, however functionality has not yet
been tested.

Planned activities:
* Test functionality and continue to implement prototype.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,
Pietra
