Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the fifth lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.

Key activities:
* Continue to work on implementing the relocation.
* More investigation was done, mainly on the `R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation.

Planned Activities:
* Continue to update planning sheet.
* Continue to work on the implementation.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

The planning spreadsheet can be found here:
