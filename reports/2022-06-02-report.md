Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 20th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
* Continue to try to implement access to secondary howto table - linking everything together. 

Planned activities:
* Continue to implement prototype and start testing.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
