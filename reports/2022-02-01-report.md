Hi all,  
  
I am sending a report regarding the third lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V  
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.  
  
Key activities:  
* Created planning sheet for this project.  
* Finished setting up the environment.  
* Started to implement relocation.  
  
Planned Activities:  
* Continue to update planning sheet.  
* Continue to work on the implementation.  
  
Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.  
  
The planning spreadsheet can be found here:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cFDyk8WvKqvrZVkNedmSuE-t3tp2bIesADtPGlYRyDE/edit?usp=sharing  
  
I am aware the planning sheet is not complete, however, any input would be much appreciated.  
  
Kind regards,
