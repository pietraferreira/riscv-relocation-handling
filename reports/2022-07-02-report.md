Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 24th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
- Continue to investigate and implement functionality taking a different approach.

Planned activities:
* Continue to implement prototype.  
* Start testing.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
