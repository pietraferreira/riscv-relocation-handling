Hi all,  
  
I am sending a report regarding the 11th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V  
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.  
  
Key activities:  
* Managed to trigger `R_RISCV_RELOCID` accompanying another relocation. However not in a meaningful way - meaning there is no functionality associated to it.  
  
Planned Activities:  
* Continue to work on implementing the relocation correctly and add functionality.  
  
Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.  
  
Kind regards,
