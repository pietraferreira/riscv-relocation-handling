Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 22nd lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
- Continue to investigate why failing to build (`undefined reference to riscv_elf_custom_relocid`).

Planned activities:
-   Continue to implement prototype.
-   Start testing.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,  
Pietra
