Hi all,  
  
I am sending a report regarding the 14th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V  
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.  
  
Key activities:  
* Starting implementing the functionality on the linker (secondary howto table and how to access it).  
  
Planned Activities:  
* Continue to investigate and implement functionality to the linker.  
  
Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.  
  
Kind regards,  
  
Pietra
