Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 10th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.

Key activities:
* Cleaned up the code and ensured it is building.
* Continued to investigate how to trigger `R_RISCV_RELOCID` as well as have it
accompany other relocations.

Planned Activities:
* Continue to investigate and try to implement functionality to the relocation.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,

Pietra
