Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 8th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.

Key activities:
* Continued to investigate why the implementation is failing to build.
* Continued to work on having R_RISCV_RELOCID accompanying other relocations - as to identify the target.

Planned Activities:
* Have the implementation building.
* Have R_RISCV_RELOCID correctly in place.
* Continue to investigate and implement functionality to the relocation.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,

Pietra
