Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the 19th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V Custom
Relocation prototype.

Key activities:
* Continue to try to implement access to secondary howto table.
* Most recent work has been pushed: https://github.com/pietraferreira/corev-binutils-gdb/commits/relocation-dev

Planned activities:
* Continue to implement prototype and soon start to test functionality.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,
Pietra
