Hi all,  
   
 I am sending a report regarding the 12th lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V  
 Custom Relocation Handling prototype.  
   
 Key activities:  
* Finished implementing the relocation in the assembler (https://github.com/pietraferreira/corev-binutils-gdb/tree/relocation-dev)  
  
Planned Activities:  
* Implement functionality on the linker.  
  
Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.  
  
Kind regards,
