Hi all,

I am sending a report regarding the seventh lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.

Key activities:
* Investigated the linker and its behaviour.
* Ran into a bug in the implementation.

Planned Activities:
* Continue to work on the implementation: more specifically fix the current bug
and continue to add functionality to the relocation.

Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.

Kind regards,

Pietra
