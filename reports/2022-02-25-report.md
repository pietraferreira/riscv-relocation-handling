Hi all,  
  
I am sending a report regarding the sixth lot of 10h worked on the RISC-V  
Custom Relocation Handling prototype.  
  
Key activities:  
* Continue investigation on the `R_RISCV_RELAX` relocation and the linker  
   to support implementation.  
  
Planned Activities:  
* Continue to work on the implementation, more specifically add functionality  
  to allow two relocations to exist within the same space.  
  
Please let me know if there's anything that needs to be reviewed.  
  
Kind regards,
